# SUFR (Surface Uplift From Relict topography)
Code to calculate surface uplift based on the method of Fox 2019. Topotoolbox is required.

This code uses topotoolbox to read in a DEM, extract a stream network, and perform an inversion of a relict river network to infer surface uplift and channel steepness index parameters across a grid.

The code writes matrices of the x grid, y grid, surface uplift and channel steepness that can be used to plot maps.
